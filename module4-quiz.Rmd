## Quiz 1 -- Shadow Banking

### Question 1
Which of the following is a form of runnable debt?

**Demand deposits** Demand deposits are runnable.


### Question 2
What does a depositor receive in exchange for depositing cash in a demand deposit?

**Insurance** In the US, for example, the depositor receives insurance from the FDIC up to a deposit threshold.


## Quiz 2 -- Safe Assets

### Question 1
What is the key feature of a *safe asset*?

**Information Insensitive** There is no incentive to produce information about a *safe asset*.


### Question 2
Which of the following can be *safe assets*?

1. **Government bonds**
2. **Currency**

Not:

- High yield bonds
- Stocks

These instruments are highly information senstive, so they are not safe assets.


## Quiz 3 -- The Global Savings Glut (GSG) Hypothesis

### Question 1
Increased demand for a bond does what?

1. **Decrease Yield (interest rate)**
2. **Increase price**

Increased demand for a good increases its price. The inverse of a bond's price is its yield - so as a bond's price increases, its yield falls.

### Question 2
What was the *conundrum* of the early 2000s described by Ben Bernanke?

**Short-term interest rates rose while long-term rates stayed the same**

Short-term rates in the U.S. increased, which would normally also increase the long-term rates. But that didn't happen: ten-year rates stayed about the same. Since mortgage rates tracked long-term (treasury bond) rates, mortgage rates remained low and enticed investors to buy into the housing market, leading to the housing bubble.


## Quiz 4 -- The Global Savings Glut (GSG): Data

### Question 1
What is agency debt?

**Debt issued by Government Sponsored Enterprises (“GSE”) like Fannie Mae**


### Question 2
Which country/region contributed most to the Global Savings Glut by purchasing safe US debt?

**China** China was the largest purchaser of safe US debt with some $700 billion in acquisitions of US Treasury securities and agency debt between 2003 and 2007.
